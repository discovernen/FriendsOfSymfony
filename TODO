= TODO

== 0.4.X or 0.5
* preferences: alternative browser setting to default one (my be Safari) for opening InBox and unread waves

* OAuth for not hundling your password (If I find a way to use OAuth for wave.google.com)

== someday/maybe
* don't count currently editing wave as an unread

* checking for online members
* contains participant names in a title of unread item

* annoyance: freeze while checking status against wave.google.com inspite of useing NSTimer. Need to use thread?

* add link to CHANGELOG and Downloads on github beside version number in the preferences window

* give some infomation with Tooltip
* ignore filter for waves (and users)
* preferences: interval time for check (should limit minimum of 5 min)
* preferences: alternative option for the number displayed at status bar (number of unread blips or unread waves)
* automatic update check for the application itself

* support http proxy (if someone need it)
* ESC key to close preferences window
