== Instruction for releasing new version
0. commit task level modification before bump up to new version
1. modify "Bundle version" in the Info.plist
2. `make zip appcast VERSION=X.X`
3. copy & paste XML snipet insert into Sparkle/appcast.xml, the higher the newer
4. upload the zip archive to github (download and test it)
5. `git commit` changes and `git push` (publish appcast.xml)
6. `git tag X.X` and `git push origin X.X`


== 0.5?
* fancy icons (gray and color) [#2]
* preferences: alternative browser setting to default one (maybe Safari) for opening InBox and unread waves [#3]


== Someday/maybe
* don't count currently editing wave as an unread

* checking for online members
* contains participant names in a title of unread item

* annoyance: avoid freezing while checking status against wave.google.com inspite of useing NSTimer. Need to use thread?

* add link to CHANGELOG and Downloads on github beside version number in the preferences window

* give some infomation with Tooltip
* ignore filter for waves (and users)
* preferences: interval time for check (should limit minimum of 5 min)
* preferences: alternative option for the number displayed at status bar (number of unread blips or unread waves)

* support http proxy (if someone need it)
* ESC key to close preferences window

== Needed, but blocked
* OAuth for not hundling your password (If I find a way to use OAuth for wave.google.com)
