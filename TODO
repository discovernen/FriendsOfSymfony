= TODO
== Instruction for releasing new version
0. Commit task level modification before bump up to new version.
1. Modify "Bundle version" in the Info.plist.
2. Update CHANGELOG (maybe TODO too).
3. Do `make zip VERSION=X.X`.
4. Upload the zip archive to github.
5. Notify the new version as a RC and wait for serious problem report.

6. If you feel OK, do `make appcast VERSION=X.X` and paste XML snipet into Sparkle/appcast.xml.
7. Do `git tag X.X`, `git commit -m "Bumped up to X.X"` and `git push master X.X`
8. Check for update from the last version


== 0.6?
* preferences: alternative browser setting to default one (maybe Safari) for opening InBox and unread waves [#3]


== Small bugs
* unread waves menu items doesn't refresh at an error

== Someday/maybe features
* don't count currently editing wave by the user self as an unread

* checking for online members
* contains participant names in a title of unread item

* annoyance: avoid freezing while checking status against wave.google.com inspite of useing NSTimer. Need to use thread?

* add link to CHANGELOG and Downloads on github beside version number in the preferences window

* give some infomation with Tooltip
* ignore filter for waves (and users)
* preferences: interval time for check (should limit minimum of 5 min)
* preferences: alternative option for the number displayed at status bar (number of unread blips or unread waves)

* ESC key to close preferences window

== Needed, but blocked
* OAuth for not hundling your password (If I find a way to use OAuth for wave.google.com)
