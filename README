= Unofficial Google Wave Notifier for mac

This is a Mac OS X menubar notification application. 
It notifies unread blips (messages) at your account of Google Wave,
like (official) Google Notifier does for GMail and Calender.


== Notes for feature compatibility against Google Wave
If they change the interface I use to access Google Wave, this app will fail.


== Anatomy (for Developer)
The outer part of the application is written in Objective-C using Cocoa Framework as usual.
However, the inner part which accessing to the Google Wave is written in Ruby.
I call the former "the app" and the later "the script".

The app periodically executes the script as a subprocess, like a following diagram.

1. app --(execute subprocess)--> script --(https request)--> Google Wave
2. app <--(plist via pipe)-- script <--(html including json via https response)-- Google Wave
That' it.

I mean that the core part is written in ruby, so you can use it for windows or other (if ruby itself is not a problem).
